      <description value="The Omnibus Care Plan (OCP) Appointment profile is used to provide information about a planned meeting that may be in the future or past. The resource only describes a single meeting, a series of repeating visits would require multiple appointment resources to be created for each instance. The visit scheduled by an appointment may be in person or remote (by phone, video conference, etc.) All that matters is that the time and usage of one or more individuals, locations and/or pieces of equipment is being fully or partially reserved for a designated period of time." />

      <description value="This OCP (Omnibus Care Plan) Communication profile describes an occurrence of information being transmitted. A communication is a conveyance of information from one entity, a sender, to another entity, a receiver and the information is delivered only once. The sender and receivers may be patients, practitioners, related persons, organizations, or devices. It identifies which core elements, extensions, and value sets SHALL be present in the resource when using this profile.&#xD;&#xA;Communication does not deal with the duration of a call, it represents the fact that information was transferred at a particular point in time." />

      <name value="OCP EpisodeOfCare Profile" />
      <description value="The EpisodeOfCare Profile contains information about an association of a Omnibus Care Plan (OCP) Patient with a Healthcare Provider for a period of time under which related healthcare activities may occur. In many cases, this represents a period of time where the Healthcare Provider has some level of responsibility for the care of the patient regarding a specific condition or problem, even if not currently participating in an encounter.&#xD;&#xA;The EpisodeOfCare profile is primarily used as a tracking resource, and contains details about the purpose of the care and can exist without any activities. The minimal information that would be required in an episode of care would be a OCP patient, organization and a reason for the ongoing association. Other reasons for creating an EpisodeOfCare could be for tracking the details required for government reporting or billing.&#xD;&#xA;The primary difference between the EpisodeOfCare and the Encounter is that the Encounter records the details of an activity directly relating to the patient, while the EpisodeOfCare is the container that can link a series of Encounters together for problems/issues.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

The location of the services could be virtual, as with TeleMedicine Services. OCP HealthcareService resources do not represent Computer related Services (not SOA). The OCP HealthcareService resource can be used with the Schedule resource to define actual availability of the service.   When creating an Appointment, the OCP HealthcareService is to be assigned to one of the participants. It is up to the scheduling system to determine if the service is available, and can be accepted.

Information about a person that is involved in the care for a patient, but who is not the target of healthcare, nor has a formal responsibility in the care process. &#xD;&#xA;RelatedPersons typically have a personal or non-healthcare-specific professional relationship to the patient. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Some systems record a collection of service values for a single location, others record the single service and the list of locations it is available. Both are acceptable options for representing this data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Qualifications (from the Practitioner resource) do not imply a Role, but might be considered when an Organization allocates practitioners to roles within their organization, and could provide useful information (such as expiry information) which could need to be tracked in some situations to ensure they continue to be eligible for a specific role." />

That detail is expected to be carried as the subject of the task. Tasks may have named inputs and outputs. Inputs represent information that may or must be present in order for a task to complete. Outputs represent intermediate or final results produced by a task. " />
