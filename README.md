# Omnibus Care Plan - OCP
Overarching OCP Git Repository 

Please look over the OCP Deployment Guide and Architecture Information.pdf in the documentation folder to get a preview on the components of the OCP systems.  The Architecture document is a Q/A response containing tidbits of information on the various components of the system.

The Omnibus Care Plan is intended to be a patient-centric, standards-based, goal-driven treatment plan through which the patient and his or her healthcare team can effectively communicate. The Omnibus Care Plan is meant to be the authoritative source for care planning. It will synthesize, reconcile, and de-conflict the patient’s data and monitor ongoing processes across health care institution boundaries.

The Omnibus Care Plan is a patient-entered, standard-based, single-source care plan management system available in one place to both the patient and the patient's Care Team. It is a preferred method of documenting the relevant care plan and treatment information across care teams and with patients. The Omnibus Care Plan web application includes patient engagement and referral capabilities as well as a care plan using Veterans Administration-defined clinical pathways for opioid management and suicide prevention.

All information is entered into the application by the care team. The Omnibus Care Plan provides a patient care plan that allows providers to view a consolidated “care-plan-of-care-plans.” It provides a real-time integrated view of an individual care plan and all associated information, including structured and narrative information. It is not specific to behavioral health but it is intended to contain all the care plans applicable to a patient.  

The Omnibus Care Plan application consists of multiple modules. It includes an Appointments module, Assessments and Screenings, Care Coordination, Care Plan, Infrastructure, Patient Registration and Management, and User Management Authorization and Authentication. It includes the Consent2Share data segmentation and consent management application.
